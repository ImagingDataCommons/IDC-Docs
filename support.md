## IDC-specific support channel

Our goal is to build an open and inclusive community of users and developers of IDC.

We encourage you to use the [IDC Discourse forum](https://discourse.canceridc.dev) for all discussions related to IDC.

If have reservations discussing the issue you want to raise in a public forum, you can send email to [support@canceridc.dev](mailto:support@canceridc.dev), and start the discussion with the IDC support team, who will then triage the issue.

## Discounted use and training materials for NIH-funded investigators

If you are an NIH-funded investigator, you can join the [NIH STRIDES Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) that offers significant discounts on the use of cloud resources, and free training courses and materials on the use of the cloud.
