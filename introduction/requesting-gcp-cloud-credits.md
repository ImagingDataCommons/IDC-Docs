# Requesting GCP cloud credits

## Cloud credits provided by IDC

{% hint style="success" %}
IDC is offering free Google Cloud credits for researchers to try out our platform!

**To apply for free pilot credits from IDC, please fill out** [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXvXqficGaVEalJI3ym6rKqarmW\_YUUWG6A4U8pclvR8MmRQ/viewform)**.**

All reasonable requests will receive an initial allocation of $300 towards storage and compute costs. We expect that this amount of funding will be more than enough for you to become familiar with the platform. If you expect that you will need additional funding to complete your planned research, this initial amount may be used to perform prototype analyses and to better estimate your total costs. At that time, you may request additional funding.
{% endhint %}

Please be aware that we will be monitoring your cloud resource usage on a daily basis and will alert you as you begin to approach your funding limit. If you exceed your allocation limit and we are not able to contact you by email for several days, we may need to take action to shut your project down which could cause you to lose work and data!

Procedures related to administration of the IDC cloud credits are outlined in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j8qKwfL0fX3yDjWLTdcnCCjiGiFsy0xXkl09y053FBM/edit).

Review of requests may take several days and we may contact you if we need further information.
