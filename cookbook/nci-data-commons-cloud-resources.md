# NCI Cloud Resources

[NCI Cloud Resources](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/analytical-tools) are components of the [NCI Cancer Research Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/) that bring data and computational power together to enable cancer research and discovery.

We are actively developing use cases that will demonstrate integration of IDC with individual cloud resources.
