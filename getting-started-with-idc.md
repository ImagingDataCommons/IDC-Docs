# Getting started

{% hint style="info" %}
Whether you are new to the cloud, or you consider yourself an expert, we encourage you to apply for a free Google cloud credits that we provide to our users to support cancer imaging research projects that work with Imaging Data Commons. All reasonable requests will receive a $300 allocation of credits that do not expire, and we will not require you to provide a credit card information to verify your identity. All you have to do is fill out and submit [this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXvXqficGaVEalJI3ym6rKqarmW\_YUUWG6A4U8pclvR8MmRQ/viewform).

The goal of IDC is to _connect_ you with the cloud-based data and compute resources.

IDC is not the place that gives you a push-button solution to your analysis needs, but aims to help you do the analyses you would usually do on your local resources faster, with better reproducibility, and at scale. Our goal in the various examples of what you can do with IDC data is to give you a taste of what can be done.

While the possibilities of what you can do with the IDC hosted data are endless, you can ...

1. Use the IDC portal to build a cohort of cases that are needed for your use case: see [demo video - Introduction to IDC portal](https://youtu.be/GE1rimW0EtM)
2. Interrogate the DICOM metadata directly from a Colab notebook (or BigQuery Console): see [demo notebook - Exploration of LIDC collection](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/LIDC\_exploration.ipynb)
3. Use Google Colab notebooks to operate on the cohort: see [demo notebook - Working with IDC cohorts](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/Cohort\_download.ipynb) and [the accompanying tutorial video](https://youtu.be/LeXBmnjYq1Q)
4. Use Google DataStudio to build interactive data dashboards for your cohort: see [example of using DataStudio to build a custom dashboard of IDC content](http://bit.ly/3jdCmON)
5. Deploy existing tools on a GCP Virtual Machine to support visualization and analysis of the data from your cohort: [learn how you can launch a desktop-like VM running 3D Slicer](cookbook/virtual-machines/idc-desktop.md)
6. Develop reproducible analysis workflows operating on public data that can be easily shared with your colleagues and referenced from your paper: see [the growing list of the Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks) implementing use cases relevant in cancer imaging (such as [the use of nnU-Net for segmenting lung nodules](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/lung\_nodules\_demo.ipynb))
