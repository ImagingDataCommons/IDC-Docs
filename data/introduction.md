# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out the [IDC Getting started tutorial](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started) for a quick introduction into data organization and main features of our repository!

IDC data is replicated as [a public dataset in the Google Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/nci-idc-data). You can see the summary dashboard of the dataset [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/04cf5976-4ea0-4fee-a749-8bfd162f2e87).

Currently, IDC is hosting data from the following data repositories:

* a [subset](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/collections/) of publicly available radiology collections and analysis results collections (in DICOM format) from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)
* whole slide pathology images (in [DICOM-TIFF format](../dicom/dicom-tiff-dual-personality-files.md)) collected by&#x20;
  * The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  * [Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac)
  * [National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) ](https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/research/nlst)
* fluorescence images (in [DICOM-TIFF format](../dicom/dicom-tiff-dual-personality-files.md)) collected by the [Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)](https://humantumoratlas.org/)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like us to prioritize an existing public TCIA collection, which is not currently included in the IDC offering, please start the discussion on our [forum](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/c/data/8)!

Check out [Data release notes](data-release-notes.md) for the information about the collections added in the individual IDC data releases.

In the following pages we discuss how to access datasets hosted by IDC and their organization.
