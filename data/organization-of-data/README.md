# Organization of data

This section describes the current organization of IDC data. The organization of data was static from IDC Version 2  through IDC Version 13 except that [clinical data](organization-of-data-v2-through-v13-deprecated/clinical.md) was added in Version 11. Development of the clinical data resource is an ongoing project. From IDC v14, our data [became available](https://registry.opendata.aws/nci-imaging-data-commons/) from the Amazon AWS Open Data Registry, and the files in storage buckets were organized into series-level folders.

We maintain three representations of the data (namely, as files in GCS and AWS Storage buckets, metadata tables in Google BigQuery tables, and DICOM instances within a Google Cloud Healthcare DICOM store). These different representations are fully synchronized and correspond to the same content, but are intended to serve different use cases.
