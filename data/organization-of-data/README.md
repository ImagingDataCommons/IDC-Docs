# Organization of data

This section describes the current organization of IDC data. The organization of data has been static since IDC Version 2 except that [clinical data](clinical.md) was added in Version 11. Development of the clinical data resource is an ongoing project. IDC Version 1 data organization is described in the [Organization of data in V1](organization-of-data-v1.md) section.

IDC storage and management of DICOM data relies on the Google Cloud Platform. We maintain three representations of the data \(namely, as files in Storage buckets, metadata tables in BigQuery tables, and DICOM instances within DICOM stores\), which are fully synchronized and correspond to the same content, but are intended to serve different use cases.

In order to access the resources listed below, it is assumed you have completed the ["getting started" steps](../../introduction/getting-started-with-gcp.md) to access the Google Cloud console!
