# Files and metadata

## Limited access content

As discussed in this community forum post, [TCIA made the decision to pull a subset of data](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/t/tcia-collections-of-brain-head-or-head-neck-cancers-are-changing-to-limited-access/241) from public access collections to limited access. At the moment, we still keep those files that used to be public in IDC before the decision made by TCIA, and the metadata for those files is still accessible in our BigQuery tables, but you cannot download those “Limited” access files referenced by `gcs_url` from IDC.

As discussed in [this post](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/t/user-does-not-have-storage-objects-list-access-to-the-google-cloud-storage-bucket/249) the issue will manifest itself in an error accessing `gcs_url` that corresponds to a non-public file:

```
AccessDeniedException: 403 <user email> does not have storage.objects.list 
access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
```

[`bigquery-public-data.idc_current.dicom_all` table](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=dicom\_all\&page=table) has a column named `access` , which takes values `Public` or `Limited` that define if the file corresponding to the instance can be accessed. For all practical purposes, if you interact with the IDC BigQuery tables, you should make sure you **exclude “Limited” access items** using the following clause in your query:

```sql
SELECT
  ...
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.idc_current.dicom_all`
WHERE
  access <> "Limited"
```

In a future release of IDC we will by default exclude limited access items from what you select in the portal, so the portal selection should be more intuitive. But if you access the data via BigQuery queries you will need to know that “Limited” are not accessible and account for this in your query.

## Storage Buckets

{% hint style="info" %}
Storage Buckets are basic containers in Google Cloud that provide storage for data objects (you can read more about the relevant terms in the Google Cloud Storage documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/key-terms)).
{% endhint %}

All IDC DICOM file data for all IDC data versions and all of the [collections hosted by IDC](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/collections/) are maintained in Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Currently all DICOM files are maintained in GCS buckets that allow for free egress within or out of the cloud, enabled through the partnership of IDC with [Google Public Datasets Program](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/gcp-public-data-idc/nci-idc-data).

The object namespace is flat, where every object name is composed of a standard format CRDC UUID and with the ".dcm" file extension, e.g. `905c82fd-b1b7-4610-8808-b0c8466b4dee.dcm`. For example, that instance can be accessed using [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) as `gs://idc-open/905c82fd-b1b7-4610-8808-b0c8466b4dee.dcm`

You can read about accessing GCP storage buckets from a Compute VM [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/gcs-buckets).

{% hint style="success" %}
Egress of IDC data out of the cloud is free, since IDC data is participating in [Google Public Datasets Program](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/gcp-public-data-idc/nci-idc-data)!
{% endhint %}

Typically, the user would not interact with the storage buckets to select and copy files (unless the intent is to copy the entire content hosted by IDC). Instead, one should use either the IDC Portal or IDC BigQuery tables containing file metadata, to identify items of interest and define a cohort. The cohort manifest generated by the IDC Portal can include both the Google Storage URLs for the corresponding files in the bucket, and the [CRDC UUIDs](guids-and-uuids.md), which can be resolved to the Google Storage URLs to access the files.

Assuming you have a list of GCS URLs in a file `gcs_paths.txt`, you can download the corresponding items using the command below, substituting `$PROJECT_ID` with the valid GCP Project ID (see the complete example in [this notebook](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/Cohort_download.ipynb)):

```bash
$ cat gcs_paths.txt | gsutil -m cp -I .
```

## BigQuery Tables

{% hint style="info" %}
Google [BigQuery (BQ)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is a massively-parallel analytics engine ideal for working with tabular data. Data stored in BQ can be accessed using [standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/enabling-standard-sql) queries.
{% endhint %}

The flat address space of IDC DICOM objects in GCS storage is accompanied by BigQuery tables that allow the researcher to reconstruct the DICOM hierarchy as it exists for any given version. There are also several BQ tables and views in which we keep copies of the metadata exposed via the TCIA interface at the time a version was captured and other pertinent information.

There is an instance of each of the following tables and views per IDC version. The set of tables and views corresponding to an IDC version are collected in a single BQ dataset per IDC version, `bigquery-public-data.idc_<idc_version_number>` where `bigquery-public-data` is the project in which the dataset is hosted. As an example, the BQ tables for IDC version 4 are in the `bigquery-public-data.idc_v4`dataset.

In addition to the per-version datasets, the `bigquery-public-data.idc-current` dataset consists of a set of BQ views. There is a view for each table or view in the BQ data set corresponding to the current IDC release. Each such view in `bigquery-public-data.idc-current` is named identically to some table or view in the `bigquery-public-data.idc_<idc_version_number> dataset of the current IDC release and can be used to access that table or view.`

Several Google BigQuery (BQ) tables support searches against metadata extracted from the data files. Additional BQ tables define the composition of each IDC data version.

We maintain several additional tables that curate metadata non-DICOM metadata (e.g., attribution of a given item to a specific collection and DOI, collection-level metadata, etc).

*   `bigquery-public-data.idc_v<idc_version_number>.auxiliary_metadata` (also available via the[ `bigquery-public-data.idc_current.auxiliary_metadata`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=auxiliary\_metadata\&page=table) view.) This table defines the contents of the corresponding IDC version. There is a row for each instance in the version.\
    Collection attributes:

    * `tcia_api_collection_id:` The ID, as accepted by the TCIA API, of the original data collection containing this instance

    *   `idc_case_id:`IDC generated UUID that uniquely identifies the patient containing this instance

        This is needed because DICOM PatientIDs are not required to be globally unique
    * `patient_hash`: the md5 hash of the sorted `study_hashes` of all studies in the patient containing this instance
    * `patient_init_idc_version:` The IDC version in which the patient containing this instance first appeared

    * `instance_uuid:`IDC assigned UUID that identifies a version of this instance.
    * `gcs_url:` The GCS URL of a file containing the version of this instance that is identified by the `instance_uuid`
    * `instance_hash`: the md5 hash of the version of this instance that is identified by the `instance_uuid`
    * `instance_size:` the size, in bytes, of this version of the instance that is identified by the `instance_uuid`

IDC utilizes the standard capabilities of the Google Healthcare API to extract all of the DICOM metadata from the hosted collections into a single BQ table. Conventions of how DICOM attributes of various types are converted into BQ form are covered in the [Understanding the BigQuery DICOM schema](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/dicom-bigquery-schema) Google Healthcare API documentation article. IDC users can access this table to conduct detailed exploration of the metadata content, and build cohorts using fine-grained controls not accessible from the IDC portal. The schema is too large to document here. Refer to the BQ table and the above referenced documentation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to the existing limitations of Google Healthcare API, not all of the DICOM attributes are extracted and are available in BigQuery tables. Specifically:

* sequences that have more than 15 levels of nesting are not extracted (see [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated)) - we believe this limitation does not affect the data stored in IDC
* sequences that contain around 1MiB of data are dropped from BigQuery export and RetrieveMetadata output currently. 1MiB is not an exact limit, but it can be used as a rough estimate of whether or not the API will drop the tag (this limitation was not documented as of writing this) - we know that some of the instances in IDC will be affected by this limitation. The fix for this limitation is targeted for sometime in 2021, according to the communication with Google Healthcare support.

* `tcga_biospecimen_rel9:` biospecimen metadata
* `tcga_clinical_rel9:` clinical metadata

### Collection-specific BigQuery tables

Some of the collections are accompanied by BigQuery tables that have not been harmonized to a single data model. Those tables are available within the BigQuery dataset corresponding to a given release, and will have the name prefix corresponding to the short name of the collection. The list below discusses those collection-specific tables.

#### NLST

{% hint style="info" %}
IDC hosts a subset of the NLST clinical data, which was cleared for public sharing. If you need the full clinical data, please visit the [Cancer Data Access System (CDAS) system](https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/learn/nlst/trial-summary/).
{% endhint %}

The following tables contain NLST specific metadata. The detailed schema of those tables is available from the [TCIA NLST collection page](https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.hmq8-j677).

* ``[`nlst_canc`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=nlst\_canc\&page=table): "Lung Cancer"
* ``[`nlst_ctab`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=nlst\_ctab\&page=table): "SCT Abnormalities"
* ``[`nlst_ctabc`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=nlst\_ctabc\&page=table): "SCT Comparison Abnormalities"
* ``[`nlst_prsn`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=nlst\_prsn\&page=table): "Participant"
* ``[`nlst_screen`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data\&d=idc\_current\&t=nlst\_screen\&page=table): "SCT Screening"

## DICOM Stores

IDC utilizes a single Google Healthcare DICOM store to host all of the instances in the current IDC version. That store, however, is primarily intended to support visualization of the data using OHIF Viewer. At this time, we do not support access of the hosted data via DICOMWeb interface by the IDC users. See more details in the [discussion here](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/t/dicomweb-access-to-hosted-collections/69), and please comment about your use case if you have a need to access data via the DICOMweb interface.

## BigQuery tables external to IDC

In addition to the DICOM data, some of the image-related data hosted by IDC is stored in additional tables. These include the following:

* BigQuery TCGA clinical data: [`isb-cgc:TCGA_bioclin_v0.clinical_v1`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=isb-cgc\&p=isb-cgc\&d=TCGA\_bioclin\_v0\&t=clinical\_v1\&page=table) . Note that this table is hosted under the ISB-CGC Google project, as documented [here](https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/BigQuery/ISBCGC-BQ-Projects.html), and its location may change in the future!
