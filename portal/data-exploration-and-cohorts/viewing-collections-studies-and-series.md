# Viewing collections, studies, and series

All collections in IDC as well as their total number of cases and number of cases in this cohort appear in the Collections panel. The panel shows the collection name, total number of cases, and total number of cases for this cohort. You can customize your display of this data by choosing how many entries to show by page and move to previous and next pages.

Click one or more collections to select them. The selected row or rows are highlighted. The available cases for the selected collection(s) appear in the Selected Cases panel. Click the up or down arrow to sort the list alphabetically or numerically, as appropriate for the column.

## Viewing data in BigQuery

After you export a cohort manifest to BigQuery, you can view IDC data in BigQuery as a BQ table. An example query follows that returns all studies for the collection QIN\_HEADNECK.

```sql
SELECT PatientID, StudyInstanceUID
FROM `canceridc-data.idc_current.dicom_all`
WHERE collection_id = 'qin_headneck'
GROUP BY PatientID, StudyInstanceUID
```
