#### 5.5.1 Configuration and Deployment

* The Throttle Proxy code lives in the GitHub Repo: 
  [https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/ThrottleProxy](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/ThrottleProxy)
* The proxy uses an instance of “Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis”, which can be configured for the project in 
  the Cloud Console (navigate to “Memorystore”). Choose a 1 GB capacity in the Basic tier (no need for high 
  availability; if we lost the data due to a failure, we would just end up doubling the quota for the day). Locate 
  it in the region where the WebApp is running. Put it on the default network.
* Since we are using App Engine Standard, we need to create a “Serverless VPC Access Connector” that allows 
  the proxy to communicate with memorystore. This can be set up in the Cloud Console (navigate to VPC 
  Network, Serverless VPC access). Put it in the same region as the Web App, and on the default network. Use an 
  address range of 10.1.0.0/28 and just use the default min and max throughput.
* The `app.yaml`, `config.txt`, and service account key file should be placed in a project deployment bucket. 
* The app.yaml needs to identify the name of the vpc_access_connector created in the previous step. The instance 
  class and scaling should be set with the consideration that many threads are hitting the proxy at once 
  as the OHIF Viewer accesses a study. The following automatci scaling configuration is what is used 
  for the production system:
  ```
    runtime: python37
    
    instance_class: F4
    
    inbound_services:
      - warmup
    
    env_variables:
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: ./privatekey.json
      IDC_THROTTLE_PROXY_CONFIG: ./config.txt
    
    #
    # This is how you wiggle worker count if you wish (here it is two):
    #
    # entrypoint: gunicorn -b :8080 -w 2 main:app
    
    service: proxy
    
    handlers:
      - url: /.*
        script: auto
        secure: always
      - url: .*
        script: auto
    
    automatic_scaling:
      min_idle_instances: 4
      max_idle_instances: 15
      min_pending_latency: 0.030s
      max_pending_latency: 15s
      max_concurrent_requests: 50
      target_cpu_utilization: 0.65
      target_throughput_utilization: 0.5
      min_instances: 4
      max_instances: 30
    
    vpc_access_connector:
      name: 'projects/<project-name>/locations/<proxy-region>/connectors/redis-connector'
    
    network:
      instance_tag: default
  ``` 
* The config.txt file holds the information about the DICOMWeb endpoint we are proxying, 
  as well as the daily byte limits.

    ```
* The service account key should be for an account that is allowed to access the DICOMWeb interface.
* CircleCI is used to handle deployment of the proxy
* The proxy writes to a Stackdriver log. Set up a log sync to write to a BigQuery table so daily byte usage 
  per IP can be analyzed over time
* A cron job is used to parse the IP usage logs into tables that are used to drive a Google Datalab dashboard
