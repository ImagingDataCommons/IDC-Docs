#### Introduction

The Throttle Proxy sits in front of the Google Cloud Healthcare DICOMWeb API and allows us to control 
the number of bytes per IP (and across all IPs) that are downloaded each day. It is also essential 
to the operation of the DICOMWeb server as a public resource, since Google does not allow 
`allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` to be set as Viewers on the DICOMStore. It runs as a simple 
Flask web application that is run on Google App Engine Standard.
