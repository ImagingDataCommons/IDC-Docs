#### 5.6.2 Bucket Setup Specifics

* Create two buckets, one for the OHIF Viewer and one for Slim. Since these buckets will be behind 
a load balancer, there is no restriction on naming other than needing to be unique 
(e.g. the bucket name does not need to be pinned to your domain).

* Put in a test file (`index.html`)

* Make the bucket uniform access allUsers as Storage Object Viewer

* Note that the `cloudCopy.sh` scripts used in the viewer deployments set the home and error 
pages for the bucket to `index.html` as needed by the React apps. Also note that cache 
control for the bucket is set to `no-cache` in those scripts as well.
