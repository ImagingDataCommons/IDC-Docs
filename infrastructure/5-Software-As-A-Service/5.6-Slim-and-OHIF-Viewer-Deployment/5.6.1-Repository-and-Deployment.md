#### 5.6.1 Repository and Deployment 

* The IDC Slim Viewer repo is at [https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-slim](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/idc-slim),
and was forked from the Herrmann Lab Slim repo (which is now part of the IDC org as well:  
[https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/slim](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/slim)). 
The IDC OHIF Viewer repo is a fork of the OHIF.org Viewers repo, and is at 
[https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/Viewers](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/Viewers). 
The developers of those systems work with the IDC team, making pull requests into the master 
branches of the IDC forks when changes that are needed by the IDC viewers are available.

* The viewers use the same CircleCI setup described above for the web application, and reuse 
the deployment service accounts used by the WebApp for each tier.. As with the webapp, 
four CircleCI environment variables need to be set  (i.e. **DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_IDC_DEV**,
**DEPLOYMENT_CLIENT_EMAIL_IDC_DEV**, **DEPLOYMENT_KEY_IDC_DEV**, and **DEPLOYMENT_PROJECT_ID_IDC_DEV**
for the dev project). Note that the OHIF project already has a `.circleci/config.yaml`, 
and the IDC fork comments those lines out and defines a deployment that matches the 
other IDC CircleCI projects.

* The OHIF viewer deployment is configured with the file `viewer_deployment_config.txt`; a sample 
of this file is found in the `idc-assets` folder of the repo. After it is customized to the 
particular deployment, that modified file should be placed in the **DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_IDC_XXX** 
bucket/folder for the tier. There is a similar file in the Slim repository that should be 
treated in the same way. 

* Note that the `.circleci/config.yaml` file is set up so that pushing to the master branch of the 
repo deploys to the dev tier, while pushing to the specified test branch deploys to
the test project, and pushing to the specified prod branch deploys to production. While 
the CircleCI system fires with each push to a branch, this configuration is set up to 
only activate the full CircleCI deployment process when one of these three branches are targets.  

* As the viewers are both client-side single page apps, we can serve up the static content of 
the radiology and pathology viewers by placing the files in buckets, and then serving out 
the contents by placing them behind the IDC load balancer, described below. These steps 
are also described by Google here:
