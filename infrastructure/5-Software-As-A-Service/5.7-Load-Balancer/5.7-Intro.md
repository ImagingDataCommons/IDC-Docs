Setting up a load balancer is required since we wish to deploy our viewers from static buckets 
served using HTTPS. It is also required since we need to deploy IDC at a fixed IP address that 
can be resolved by a _non-Google DNS system (e.g. cancer.gov)_, 
 
If these were not requirements, it is possible to use the Google App Engine default load 
balancer provided by system at the standard `https://projectname.appspot.com` hostname. 
Even if you wish to run on your own domain, e.g. `https://portal.example.com`, as long
as you use Google Domains to handle DNS for your domain, then you can still use the 
standard App Engine default load balancer. This section details the necessary steps 
to set up the system in the same configuration as the IDC.

IDC uses a single custom load balancer to handle all the services (WebApp, API, OHIF, Slim, 
and the proxy) as cancer.gov systems. The one difference with the production system 
(compared to the dev, test, and UAT systems that run at the Google-managed canceridc.dev 
domain) is that it needs an NCI-provided SSL cert, and must be coordinated with NCI IT 
to maintain the DNS resolution for the domain. The web app, proxy, adn API need 
to be wrapped in “serverless network endpoint groups”, or “serverless negs”. 

There are many steps, layers, and components involved in setting this up. The
commands described through all the sections are consistent, and reference shell
variables described in previous sections.
