#### 5.7.4 Create the SSL Certificate

For dev, test, and UAT, we have Google provision an SSL cert: 
 
 **TODO: Wildcard cert for machine name???**

```
CERT_NAME=my-ssl-cert # For example... choose the id tag for your cert
# Comma-spearated list of machine names the cert will apply too: 
MACHINE_NAMES=portal.example,com,proxy.example.com,viewer.example.com,api.canceridc.dev

gcloud compute ssl-certificates create ${CERT_NAME} \
  --description="${DESCRIPT}" --domains=${MACHINE_NAMEs} \
  --global --project=${PROJECT_ID}

gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe ${CERT_NAME} --global \
  --format="get(name,managed.status, managed.domainStatus)" \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}

```
For production, since Google Domains is not being used for DNS resolution,
we need to have a cert generated for e.g. `*.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov` 
and securely have the cert and the key sent to us; we then place them in 
in a secure storage bucket. For IDC, this step is handled by the NCI.
Note we need to get a "star (*) cert", since we are going to run four 
different hosts off the one cert:

```
# Variable names are self-explanatory

echo "Using NCI-provided SSL cert for this project"
echo "Fetch cert and key"
gsutil cp gs://${CERT_BUCKET_FILE_PATH} ${CERT_LOCAL_FILE_PATH}
gsutil cp gs://${KEY_BUCKET_FILE_PATH} ${KEY_LOCAL_FILE_PATH}
echo "Create cert"

gcloud compute ssl-certificates create ${CERT_NAME} \
  --description="${DESCRIPT}" --certificate=${CERT_LOCAL_FILE_PATH} \
  --private-key=${KEY_LOCAL_FILE_PATH} --global --project=${PROJECT_ID}

gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe ${CERT_NAME} --global \
  --format="get(name,managed.status, managed.domainStatus)" \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID}
  
echo "Delete local cert and key"
rm ${CERT_LOCAL_FILE_PATH}
rm ${KEY_LOCAL_FILE_PATH}
echo "Done cert create"
```

Note that once a cert is created, it takes several (10-20) minutes to “provision”, 
and the system must be up and running for this to take place.
