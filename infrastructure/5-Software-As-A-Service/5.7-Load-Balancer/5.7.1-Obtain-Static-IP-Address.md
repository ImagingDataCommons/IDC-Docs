#### 5.7.1 Obtain a Static IP Address

We need to get a reserved static IP address from Google to use for the DNS entry. Run:

```
IP_NAME=your_static_ip_tag_name  # For example... choose your own id tag for this static IP.
PROJECT_ID=your_google_project_id

gcloud compute addresses create ${IP_NAME} --network-tier=PREMIUM \
--ip-version=IPV4 --global --project=${PROJECT_ID}

MY_IP=`gcloud compute addresses describe ${IP_NAME} --format="get(address)" \
--global --project=${PROJECT_ID}`
```

For non-production tiers, create a DNS record in Google Domains for the desired 
hostnames pointing to the IP address. Since all the components of IDC use the same
load balancer, you will have four hostnames (e.g. `dev-api.example.com`, 
`dev-portal.example.com`, `dev-proxy.example.com`, and `dev-viewer.example.com`) 
resolving to your single reserved IP address.
