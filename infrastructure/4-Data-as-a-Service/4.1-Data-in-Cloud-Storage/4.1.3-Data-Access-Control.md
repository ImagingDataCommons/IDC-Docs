#### 4.1.3 Data Access Control
Access to the data buckets hosted by IDC is controlled using the uniform bucket-level access policy provided by 
Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM). This means that all objects in the bucket are 
subject to the exact same access policy. The special ID `allUsers` is provided with the `Storage Object Viewer` 
role. Note this approach is in contrast to controlling access with more fine-grained Access Control Lists.
