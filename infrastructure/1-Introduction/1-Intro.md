This infrastructure documentation describes the process whereby a system administrator, 
familiar the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), can stand-up their own instance of IDC based on the 
IDC code base in GitHub and accompanying project infrastrucure on GCP. A fully working version of the
IDC system can be hosted on just GCP, though starting in 2023 IDC is also hosting files on
the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. That recent extension is not currently covered in this
documentation.
