## Cloud-based analysis

* Connect cancer researchers with the data and compute resources co-located on the cloud.
* Enable building of imaging-focused cohorts for cross-omics analyses.

## FAIR science

* Implement and refine FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) data stewardship principles as applied to cancer imaging research.
* Apply DICOM standard to harmonize imaging and image-derived cancer imaging data.
* Define best practices and worked out examples for using and generating FAIR data.

## Use cases

* Apply the developed technology to solve meaningful research problems in radiology, digital pathology, and other domains.
* Develop examples of harmonization of images, image-derived, and image-related data.

## Open source

* Simplify access to open source image computing tools.
* Support adoption of IDC-developed tools.

## Community building

* Identify and address unmet needs of the cancer imaging community.
* Promote openness, support, and education.
