**NCI Imaging Data Commons** **(IDC)** is a cloud-based environment containing publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader NCI [Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.&#x20;

IDC maintains data and makes it available for download (free egress) both in the Google GCP and Amazon AWS clouds.

IDC **connects** researchers with&#x20;

1. Cancer image collections
2. Robust infrastructure that contains imaging data, subject and sample metadata, and experimental metadata from disparate sources
3. Resources for searching, identifying, and viewing images, and
4. Additional data types contained in other Cancer Research Data Commons nodes (e.g., [Genomics Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/genomic-data-commons) and [Proteomic Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/proteomic-data-commons)).
